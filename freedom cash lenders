Borrowing through a freedom cash lenders lending platform has a similar application process to traditional loans. You'll fill out an application that may include identifying the reason you're applying, the amount needed, your income, employer, and supporting documents. You may also be subject to a credit inquiry.

Investors decide whether to fund your loan, and if approved, the platform advances the proceeds to you. As you repay the loan, the proceeds get distributed to the investors or lenders until your loan is paid in full.
